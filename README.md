# Javascript Web Applications: Notes App

----

## Objective

A series of exercises to help me learn the following:

* [x] To be able to test-drive a "Client" class that uses fetch to send HTTP requests (mocking `fetch`)



## How to run it

1. Make sure to have `NVM` - the Node Version Manager installed, so we can use it to install a program called Node.js("node"). **Node** is a Javascript runtime - it reads JavaScript code and execute it as a program.
installation instructions for `NVM` in [this link here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

2. Install Node using the command line:

```bash
nvm install node
nvm use node
```

3. You can then type `node` in the command line, to launch the node REPL:

```bash
node
```

<!-- ## How to run it:

```bash
npm install
```

``bash
npm run build
``` -->
