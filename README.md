# Javascript Web Applications: Notes App

----

## Objective

To build a JavaScript frontend web project (a small notes-taking app) and help me apply what I have learnt on:

* how different JavaScript files can be bundled into one single file. (using `esbuild` build tool) and how this bundle file is loaded by the HTML page.

* how to log messages & variables printed in the developer tools console using console.log (useful when debugging)

* how to use Javascript to dynamicallly add new elements on the page and change the page content. (by manipulating the DOM)

* how to test-drive features such as a user event, user input for a frontend web application

* how to write tests to check the updates to the web page (using `jest`)

* how to use JavaScript to handle an event (a mouse click), read the value from a form input and change the web page dynamically in response to the user interaction.

* how to fetch and use the response data received by fetch to update the state of a web application on a remote server. (using `fetch` to send HTTP GET request and retrieve data from a remote server/api)

* how to use `fetch` to make a HTTP POST request

## Evidence

* Built a JavaScript single page app
* Written fully isolated tests on each class



## How to run it

1. Make sure to have `NVM` - the Node Version Manager installed, so we can use it to install a program called Node.js("node"). **Node** is a Javascript runtime - it reads JavaScript code and execute it as a program.
installation instructions for `NVM` in [this link here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

2. Install Node using the command line:

```bash
nvm install node
nvm use node
```

3. You can then type `node` in the command line, to launch the node REPL:

```bash
node
```

<!-- ## How to run it:

```bash
npm install
```

``bash
npm run build
``` -->
